# CAN_RS232_Interface

Mechatronic Project at Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical Engineering: Implementation of a CAN-RS232 Interface for a ventilator.

CODE AND MORE INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED AFTER THE PROJECT IS DONE!

First Step:
Level converter circuit was designed in EAGLE to read the data from the RS232 protocol
via the UART pins from the microcontroller. The micrcontroller was programmed in C using CCS.

Second Step:
Buffering the received data and sending it to the CAN bus.
A CAN controller circuit was designed for this purpose.

Third Step:
Designing a case for the whole circuit via FUSION 360.

Used Software: Code Composer Studio, PCAN View, hterm

Used Hardware: MSP430G2 LaunchPad Development kit, PCAN-USB, Ventilator for testing
